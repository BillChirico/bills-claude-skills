## Company Boilerplate

## Short (50 words)

Volvox LLC is a New Jersey-based software company building apps that help people make better decisions and stay accountable—because apparently we all need a little help with both. Our products include Decision Jar (for the chronically indecisive) and Sobers (recovery accountability, done right). Founded in 2020, we believe software should be useful, well-crafted, and respect the people who use it.

## Medium (100 words)

Volvox LLC is a software development company based in New Jersey, building SaaS products and mobile apps that solve real problems—not problems we invented to sell you a subscription. Our flagship products, Decision Jar and Sobers, help people overcome decision fatigue and stay accountable in recovery, respectively. One shakes a jar, the other might save a life. Both matter. Founded in 2020 out of a developer learning community that started in 2018, Volvox operates with a dual mission: creating practical software solutions and fostering an inclusive developer community built on the principle of "no gatekeeping." We ship quality software with no dark patterns and no shortcuts—just uncomfortably thorough code reviews.

## Long (150 words)

Volvox LLC is a New Jersey-based software development company building SaaS products, mobile apps, and a developer learning community that actually likes each other. Named after the colonial green algae where each cell works for the benefit of the whole—cooperation without hierarchy—Volvox embodies collaborative software development. Yes, we named a company after pond water. It tracks.
Our products include Decision Jar, a playful app helping overthinkers break through analysis paralysis (you're welcome, dinner plans), and Sobers, a recovery accountability app connecting sponsors with sponsees—because accountability shouldn't require a spreadsheet and a prayer. Both reflect our belief that software should be useful, well-crafted, and respect its users.
Founded in 2020 by Bill Chirico, Volvox grew from a Discord community of developers teaching and learning together. That DNA remains in everything we build: products that help people, code that doesn't cut corners, and a belief that we all get better when we work together. No dark patterns. No shortcuts. Just quality software, one commit at a time.

## Founder

### Bill Chirico

**Title:** Founder & CEO

**Bio (Short):**
Bill Chirico is the founder and CEO of Volvox LLC, a software development company building apps that help people make better decisions and stay accountable—two things most of us could use a hand with. Based in New Jersey (yes, on purpose), Bill is a software engineer who believes software should respect its users, not trick them into a subscription they'll forget to cancel. He founded Volvox in 2020 after building a developer learning community in 2018, because apparently one full-time job wasn't enough.

**Bio (Medium):**
Bill Chirico is the founder and CEO of Volvox LLC, a New Jersey-based software company behind Decision Jar, Sobers, and the Volvox developer community. A software engineer by trade, Bill started the Volvox developer community in 2018 as a Discord server for developers teaching and learning together. In 2020, that community became a company. Bill believes software should be useful, well-crafted, and respect the people who use it—a philosophy that drives every product Volvox builds. He's pretty much been raised to start his own company his entire life, and Volvox is the result of that drive meeting the right people at the right time.

## Why the name "Volvox"?

Volvox is a colonial green algae—a microscopic organism where thousands of individual cells form a single, rolling sphere. Each cell has its own job, but none of them go rogue and start a side hustle. They work together, no hierarchy, no corner offices, no cells claiming they "basically built the whole colony."

Every cell contributes to the movement, survival, and reproduction of the whole organism. It's cooperation baked into biology—collaboration isn't a company value plastered on a wall, it's literally how they stay alive.

That's the energy we wanted for Volvox LLC. We build software the same way: every contributor matters, every line of code serves the product, and the community isn't a marketing buzzword—it's the foundation we grew from. Our developer community started in 2018, two years before we ever shipped a product. The community came first because that's how Volvox actually works in nature. The colony comes first.

So yes, we named a software company after pond algae. But when you find an organism that figured out teamwork about 200 million years before corporate America tried, you take the name and run with it.
