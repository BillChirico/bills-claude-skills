### Long (150 words)
Volvox LLC is a New Jersey-based software development company building SaaS products, mobile apps, and a thriving developer learning community. Named after the colonial green algae where each cell works for the benefit of the whole—cooperation without hierarchy—Volvox embodies collaborative software development.

Our products include Decision Jar, a playful app helping overthinkers break through analysis paralysis, and Sobers, a recovery accountability app connecting sponsors with sponsees. Both reflect our belief that software should be useful, well-crafted, and respect its users.

Founded in 2020 by Bill Chirico, Volvox grew from a Discord community of developers teaching and learning together. That DNA remains in everything we build: products that help people, software that respects its users, and a belief that we all get better when we work together. No dark patterns. No shortcuts. Just quality software, one commit at a time.
