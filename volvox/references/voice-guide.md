### Sobers 🌱

**One-liner:** Your support system, one tap away.

**Audience:** People in recovery programs (AA, NA, etc.), sponsors, sponsees

**Where they are:** Recovery communities, Facebook groups, Reddit (r/stopdrinking, r/alcoholicsanonymous), word of mouth

**Example Copy:**

- "Every day counts. We help you count them."
- "Your journey. Your people. Your pace."
- "Built for the hard days and the good ones."
- "Connection is the opposite of addiction. Stay connected."

**Example Tweets:**

Milestone:

> Day 1 or Day 1,000 — every single one matters.
>
> Sobers helps you track your journey and stay connected to the people who have your back. 🌱

Supportive:

> Recovery isn't linear. Some days are harder than others.
>
> That's exactly why having your people one tap away matters.

**CRITICAL:** Never make light of addiction or recovery. No jokes. Earnest and supportive always. This audience has seen predatory recovery apps—trust is earned.

## Social Media Guidelines

### Twitter/X Style

- Hook in the first line
- One idea per tweet
- Emojis: sparingly (1-2 max)
- Hashtags: rarely, only if useful
- Threads for longer thoughts, not walls of text

### Engagement

- Reply like a human, not a brand
- Celebrate others' wins genuinely
- Ask questions, start conversations
- Admit when we don't know something

## Content Themes

- Product launches and updates
- Software development insights
- Decision-making tips/humor (Decision Jar)
- Recovery support (Sobers)
- Open source wins
- Developer mentorship
- Building in public
- Tech stack opinions

## Quick Reference

1. **Decision Jar** = playful, self-aware humor about indecision
2. **Sobers** = warm, supportive, respectful—never jokey about recovery
3. **Volvox Community** = encouraging, inclusive—celebrate all contributions
4. **Volvox overall** = witty but genuine, professional but human
5. Keep it short. Shorter than you think.
6. Read it out loud. If it sounds like a brand, rewrite it.
