## Visual Identity

### Colors

| ---------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Primary Blue     | `#007AFF` | Primary backgrounds, CTAs, links        |
| Secondary Purple | `#AF58DA` | Accents, highlights, gradients          |
| Accent Orange    | `#FF9500` | Attention, warnings, interactive states |
| White            | `#FFFFFF` | Text on dark backgrounds, cards         |
| Dark Gray        | `#1C1C1E` | Body text, dark mode backgrounds        |

### Typography

- **Font:** JetBrains Mono (monospace)
- **Fallback:** `'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', 'SF Mono', Consolas, monospace`
- **Weights:** 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 700 (bold)

### Logo

- Mark: Stylized volvox organism (cell colony) in white on blue
- Square version: [`assets/logo.png`](assets/logo.png) (full bleed)
- Circle version: [`assets/circle.png`](assets/circle.png) (avatar, rounded contexts)
- Minimum clear space: Equal to the height of the smaller cell

## Voice & Tone

### Core Characteristics

- **Witty but not try-hard** — Clever observations, not forced puns
- **Professional but approachable** — Knows the craft, not stuffy
- **Confident but humble** — Proud of work, honest about learning
- **Human-first** — Talks like a person, not a brand
- **Professional humor** — Funny, but professional

### Writing Style

- Short, punchy sentences. Like this.
- Occasional fragments for emphasis.
- Questions that make people think.
- Em dashes for asides—essential.

### Do/Don't

| Do        | Don't                   |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| "Ship"    | "Create" or "craft"     |
| "Build"   | "Develop solutions"     |
| "People"  | "Users" (when possible) |
| "Help"    | "Empower"               |
| "Quality" | "Game-changer"          |

**Avoid:** Synergy, leverage, disrupt, revolutionary, unlock potential, anything that sounds like LinkedIn.

## Product-Specific Tones

### Decision Jar 🫙

**Tone:** Playful, lighthearted, self-aware humor about indecision, but also humorous.

Examples:

- "Your brain has mass debated enough for one day."
- "For when 'I don't care, you pick' isn't working."
- "Finally, an app that makes decisions so you don't have to spiral."
- "

### Sobers 🌱

**Tone:** Warm, supportive, respectful. Never jokey about recovery. Hope without toxic positivity.

Examples:

- "Every day counts. We help you count them."
- "Your journey. Your people. Your pace."
- "Built for the hard days and the good ones."
- "Connection is the opposite of addiction. Stay connected."
- "Think Jira for your sobriety.
- "Your support system, one tap away."

**Critical:** Never make light of addiction or recovery.

### Volvox Community 🌐

**Tone:** Encouraging, inclusive, practical. Celebrate contributions of all sizes.

Examples:

- "Your first PR doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to exist."
- "Open source isn't charity. It's how we all get better."
- "Learn by building. Grow by shipping. Repeat."
- "Every senior dev was once mass Googling 'how to center a div.'"
- "Shipped a bug fix at 11pm because it was bothering me."
