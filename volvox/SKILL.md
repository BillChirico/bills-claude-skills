# Volvox Brand Guidelines

Apply Volvox's brand identity to visual artifacts and written content.

## Visual Identity

### Colors
| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| Primary Blue | `#007AFF` | Primary backgrounds, CTAs, links |
| Secondary Purple | `#AF58DA` | Accents, highlights, gradients |
| Accent Orange | `#FF9500` | Attention, warnings, interactive states |
| White | `#FFFFFF` | Text on dark backgrounds, cards |
| Dark Gray | `#1C1C1E` | Body text, dark mode backgrounds |

### Typography
- **Font:** JetBrains Mono (monospace)
- **Fallback:** `'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', 'SF Mono', Consolas, monospace`
- **Weights:** 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 700 (bold)

### Logo
- Mark: Stylized volvox organism (cell colony) in white on blue
- Square version: `assets/logo.png` (full bleed)
- Circle version: `assets/circle.png` (avatar, rounded contexts)
- Minimum clear space: Equal to the height of the smaller cell

## Voice & Tone

### Core Characteristics
- **Witty but not try-hard** — Clever observations, not forced puns
- **Professional but approachable** — Knows the craft, not stuffy
- **Confident but humble** — Proud of work, honest about learning
- **Human-first** — Talks like a person, not a brand

### Writing Style
- Short, punchy sentences. Like this.
- Occasional fragments for emphasis.
- Questions that make people think.
- Em dashes for asides—essential.

### Do/Don't
| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Ship" | "Create" or "craft" |
| "Build" | "Develop solutions" |
| "People" | "Users" (when possible) |
| "Help" | "Empower" |
| "Quality" | "Game-changer" |

**Avoid:** Synergy, leverage, disrupt, revolutionary, unlock potential, anything that sounds like LinkedIn.

## Product-Specific Tones

### Decision Jar 🫙
**Tone:** Playful, lighthearted, self-aware humor about indecision.

Example: "Your brain has mass debated enough for one day."

### Sobers 🌱
**Tone:** Warm, supportive, respectful. Never jokey about recovery. Hope without toxic positivity.

Example: "Every day counts. We help you count them."

**Critical:** Never make light of addiction or recovery.

### Volvox Community 🌐
**Tone:** Encouraging, inclusive, practical. Celebrate contributions of all sizes.

Example: "Your first PR doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to exist."
