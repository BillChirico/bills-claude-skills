Use when: (1) A PR has review comments that need to be addressed and resolved, (2) CI/CD checks are failing and need fixes, (3) You want to process all PR feedback and mark conversations as resolved, (4) You need to iterate on PR feedback quickly. IMPORTANT: This skill processes EVERY comment - no skipping allowed. Always fetches fresh data from GitHub. The only acceptable end state is zero unresolved threads."
